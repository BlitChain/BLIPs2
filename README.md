# BLit Improvement Proposals (BLIPs)

BLit Improvement Proposals (BLIPs) describe standards for the Blitchain project, Blitlang specs, and BlitJS clients.

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the [BLIP Process](./blips/process.md) document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed prior to opening a pull request,
in a [GitHub issue in this repository](https://github.com/BlitChain/BLIPs/issues). BLIPs should begin by copying the
[blip-template](./blip-template.md).

## Project Goal

The Blit Improvement Proposals repository exists as a place to share concrete proposals with potential users of the proposal and the Blip community at large.
